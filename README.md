## 👋 Hi, I’m Andrea Selmi  
### 🎯 Frontend Developer

I'm a passionate **Frontend Developer** with 3+ years of experience in building high-performance and scalable **web and mobile applications**.  
My journey started from graphic design and evolved into tech, allowing me to work closely with designers and product teams to build **engaging user experiences** and **robust design systems**.

Currently, I work on:
- **React** web application used by thousands of students
- **Monorepos** with Nx
- **Design Systems** with full test coverage & Storybook
- **Microfrontend architectures**
- CI/CD pipelines with code quality automation

💡 Always learning, experimenting, and improving — I love exploring new technologies and applying them in both personal and professional projects.
